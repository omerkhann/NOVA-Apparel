Men's Apparel Website (Static Front-End Project)
A minimalist, static website designed to showcase a men's fashion brand, built using pure HTML and CSS. Focused entirely on clean layout, visual appeal, and responsive design principles, the site mimics a commercial retail experience with high-quality images sourced from Urban Outfitters.

- Notes
Images are for demonstration only and sourced from Urban Outfitters' public site.
No interactivity or dynamic content â€” purely a design and layout exercise.
